# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pyblake2: pyblake2 
pyblake2:
pyblake2: ipyblake2 is an extension module for Python implementing BLAKE2 hash 
pyblake2: function.
pyblake2: BLAKE2 is a cryptographic hash function, which offers highest security
pyblake2: while being as fast as MD5 or SHA-1, and comes in two flavors:
pyblake2: BLAKE2b, optimized for 64-bit platforms and produces digests of any 
pyblake2: size between 1 and 64 bytes, BLAKE2s, optimized for 8- to 32-bit 
pyblake2: platforms and 
pyblake2: produces digests of any size between 1 and 32 bytes.
pyblake2: BLAKE2 supports keyed mode (a faster and simpler replacement for HMAC), 
pyblake2: salted hashing, personalization, and tree hashing.
pyblake2: Hash objects from this module follow the API of standard libraryâ€™s 
pyblake2: hashlib objects.
