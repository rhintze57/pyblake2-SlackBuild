pyblake2 is an extension module for Python implementing BLAKE2 hash function.
BLAKE2 is a cryptographic hash function, which offers highest security while being as fast as MD5 or SHA-1, and comes in two flavors:
BLAKE2b, optimized for 64-bit platforms and produces digests of any size between 1 and 64 bytes,
BLAKE2s, optimized for 8- to 32-bit platforms and produces digests of any size between 1 and 32 bytes.
BLAKE2 supports keyed mode (a faster and simpler replacement for HMAC), salted hashing, personalization, and tree hashing.
Hash objects from this module follow the API of standard libraryâ€™s hashlib objects.
